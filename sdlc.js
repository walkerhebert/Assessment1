const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step, the developer will gather any and all specific details required for a new code, as well as determining the first ideas."

const design = "In this stage, a developer will outline the details for the application and its specific assets"

const implementation = "This is the stage where the engineering team actually codes the product. At this stage, the development team translates the high-level overview communicated in the roadmap into a tactical set of assignments, due dates, and day-to-day work schedules."

const testingAndIntergration = "After the team has completed a version of the software, they will release it to a testing environment. Here, the QA team and the developers will test all areas of the application to spot any defects, bugs, or other problems."

const maintain = "In this final step, The developers will need to be ready to address requests for enhancements, bug fixes, and new features."
